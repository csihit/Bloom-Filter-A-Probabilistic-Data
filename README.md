This project is a simple Bloom Filter implementation using four custom hash functions (h1, h2, h3, h4) to perform fast membership testing in a fixed-size bit array. Elements are inserted by hashing them into multiple positions and setting corresponding bits, while lookups check if all these bits are set, indicating the element is probably present. This approach is highly space-efficient, allows false positives but no false negatives, and is demonstrated here with a sample dataset of positive and negative words, making it useful for applications like caching, duplicate detection, spell checking, and filtering in large-scaleÂ systems.
